<h3>What to bring:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Balloons (I've always enjoyed the whimsical charm of balloons. Having balloons for my birthday would bring a big smile to my face.)</li>
  <li>Cake (cake is one of my favorite treats, so a birthday cake would make my celebration extra sweet.)</li>
  <li>Gifts (I've made a list of things I'd love to receive as birthday gifts, if you'd like to know.)</li>
</ul>
